[planned] Running until software is stopped: Instance of IndefiniteWorld

### [planned] Setting up AI agents
[planned] Hard-coding an AI: Inherit from Actor
[planned] Self-learning AI: Instance of Learner

### [planned] Customizing
[planned] Creating a module for AI: Inherit from Module
[planned] Creating a custom neuron: Inherit from HiddenNode

### [planned] Utilizing the world/surrounding as an AI
[planned] Add an input or output node linked to a Module (Create all the logic in the Module)


### [planned] Using the dynamic loader:
- Create an instance of Loader with the path to the nodes and modules. 
- Whenever a new Actor or Learner is made, link the loader when creating, so that the loader can add the relevant modules and neurons.
